In this project, I designed a RISC-V single-cycle processor from scratch involves understanding each of its key components. A single-cycle processor completes every instruction in one clock cycle, making the design simple, but it lacks the efficiency of more complex multi-cycle processors. The RISC-V processor, an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA), is known for its simplicity, modularity, and extensibility, making it an excellent choice for both learning and research.

ABOUT RISC-V
RISC-V, a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture, is open-source, designed for simplicity and flexibility. Its modular nature supports a variety of extensions, such as integer, floating-point, and atomic operations. RISC-V is widely adopted for educational purposes, research, and commercial applications due to its straightforward design and adaptability.

For a comprehensive understanding of RISC-V architecture and design principles, consult "Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface" by David Patterson and John Hennessy.
